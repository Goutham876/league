# knockout tournament

Technology used vinilla javascript, html and css.


Simple leage tournament :
-> Teams are randomly picked and allotted into specific groups.
-> Teams can be shuffeled at any given time.
-> Clear buttons clears the content.
-> Each level in the group contains the play button which will pick the random winner from the group.
-> List grows smaller based on winner and runners up.
-> NOTE: Did not implement the second part since repetition of code and due to time constraints.
