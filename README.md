# league

Simple leage tournament :
-> Teams are randomly picked and allotted into specific groups.
-> each level in the group contains the play button which will pick the random winner from the group.
-> list grows smaller based on winner and runners up.
-> NOTE: Did not implement the second part since repetition of code and due to time constraints.
